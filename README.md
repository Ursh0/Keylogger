# COMP6841 SAP – Keylogger & Social Engineering Project (Educational)

## Disclaimer

This project was developed strictly for **educational purposes** as part of the UNSW course **COMP6841 – Something Awesome Project (SAP)**.  
All testing was conducted with **explicit participant consent**.  
The purpose of this project is to understand how real-world attacks operate in order to improve defensive security practices and awareness.  

This repository must **not** be used for malicious purposes or deployed against systems or individuals without permission.

## Project Overview

This project explores the relationship between technical attack mechanisms and human behaviour in cybersecurity incidents.  
It demonstrates how attacks often succeed not purely because of technical vulnerabilities, but due to social engineering, trust exploitation, and weak security practices.

The project combines:
- A technical prototype demonstrating keystroke capture concepts  
- Encryption and secure handling of collected data  
- A simulated social engineering delivery scenario  

The overall goal is defensive education: understanding attacker methods to design better protections.

---

## Objectives

The project aims to:
- Demonstrate how malicious tooling can be constructed at a conceptual and technical level  
- Explore how social engineering significantly increases attack success rates  
- Highlight weaknesses in user behaviour and security awareness  
- Apply ethical constraints and informed consent throughout experimentation  

---

## Technical Scope (High-Level)

This project includes a prototype that demonstrates:

- Keystroke capture concepts  
- Local logging of captured input  
- Basic encryption mechanisms for stored data  
- File handling and persistence  
- Controlled execution logic for demonstration purposes  
- Analysis of how similar tools are abused in real-world attacks  

The implementation is intentionally simplified and exists purely for academic demonstration rather than real-world deployment.

## Security and Ethical Focus

A significant component of this project is the written security analysis, which discusses:

- Why users fall victim to phishing and malicious payloads  
- The role of trust, authority, and context in social engineering  
- Common behavioural patterns that attackers exploit  
- Defensive lessons, including:
  - Security awareness training  
  - Safer software design practices  
  - Principle of least privilege  
  - Reducing attack surface through policy and tooling  

---

## Repository Contents

This repository contains:
- Source code for the educational prototype  
- Supporting scripts and utilities  
- Documentation and artefacts relevant to the project  

All content is provided for learning and assessment purposes only.

## Ethical Use

If you are viewing this repository:
- Do not use this code against others  
- Do not deploy on machines you do not own or have permission to test  
- Use it strictly as a learning resource for defensive security understanding  

Misuse of security tooling can be illegal and unethical.
